## How to Start
The service runs on localhost:3000. Ensure that Port 3000 is free and nothing else is running on it

Have Nodejs and NPM installed. Once installed pull the repo and run:
```sh
$ npm install
```
Once packages have been installed run:
```sh
$ npm run
```
You will need the environment variable DB_URI to connect to the database

## Purpose of EPMS-Service

EPMS-Service is the backend to the Employee Patient Management Service

Deployed Link: https://epms-service-api-q8l3e.ondigitalocean.app/

## Auth Module
The Auth module handles the following actions:
- Logging in
- Changing password

The routes:

| HTTP | Route | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| PATCH  | /auth/password | Change the password of a user |
| POST | /auth/login | Log a user of the system in |

### PATCH /auth/password
```
{
    password: string,
    newpassword: string
}
```
In the request header, the Authorization header must be set with a bearer token given during login.

### POST /auth/login
```
{
    userid: string,
    password: string
}
```

Response on a successful login:
```
{
    token: string
}
```

### POST /auth
This route allows the client to see if a user currently using the system is authorized to perform an action.

*A Token must be provided in the `Authorization` Header*

Please refer to [Authorization](#authorization) to understand how to set up the header

The following is what should be sent in the request body:
```
{
    authorization: [
        'PERMISSION'
    ]
}
```
`Authorization` is an array of string values that can only be the following: `nurse`, `doctor`, `administrator`, `receptionist`, `vendor`

If you are using angular, you can create a Permissions.ts file and enter the following into the file:
```Typescript
export const PERMISSIONS = {
    ADMIN: 'administrator',
    NURSE: 'nurse',
    DOCTOR: 'doctor',
    VENDOR: 'vendor',
    RECEPTIONIST: 'receptionist'
}
```

You can put multiple of these permissions into one request. If one matches what permissions to the token, true is returned.

The following is what the response will look like:
```
{
    isAuthorized: boolean
}
```

## Error Responses

Errors can occur for many different reasons.

The following is how the error response will be formatted:
```
{
    code: number,
    message: string
}
```

## Authorization

Authorization in EHRS will be done with [JWTs](https://jwt.io/) 

The decrypted token will have the following format:
```
{
    employeeid: string,
    permission: administrator | nurse | vendor | receptionist | doctor
    ...
}
```
Tokens will expire after 8 hours of creation.

When a successful login happens, a hashed token will be sent, this token can be used in the `Authorization` header of every request. All request require some form of authorization.

Your `Authorization` header should be formatted in the following way: `Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}` 

If you are using Angular with the httpclient module for http request, use this code snippet for your authorization headers:

```Typescript
headers: HttpHeaders = new HttpHeaders();
function foo() {
    this.headers = this.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${Token}`);
}
```
